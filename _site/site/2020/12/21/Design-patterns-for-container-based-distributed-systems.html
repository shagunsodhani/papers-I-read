<ul>
  <li>The paper describes three design patterns for container-based distributed systems: single-container pattern, single-node pattern, and multi-node pattern.</li>

<h2 id="single-container-management-patterns">Single-container management patterns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Traditionally, containers have exposed three functions: run, pause and stop.</li>
  <li>A richer API can be implemented to provide fine-grained control to system developers and operators.</li>
  <li>Similarly, much more application information (including monitoring metrics) can be exposed.</li>
  <li>The container interface can be used to define a contract for a complex lifecycle. For example, instead of arbitrarily shutting down the container, the system could signal that it will be terminated, giving the container some time to perform some cleanup/follow-up actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="single-node-multi-container-pattern">Single-node, multi-container pattern</h2>

<h3 id="sidecar-pattern">Sidecar pattern</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple containers extend and enhance the main container.</li>
  <li>For example, a web-server serves from the local disk (main container) while a side container updates the data.</li>
  <li>Benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>independent development, deployment, and scaling of containers</li>
      <li>possibility of combining different type of containers</li>
      <li>failure containment boundary, i.e., one failing container, need not bring down the entire system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ambassador-pattern">Ambassador pattern</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Proxy communication to and from the main container with the ambassador hiding the complexities of communication with a distributed (multi-shard system) that may be written in a different language.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adapter-pattern">Adapter pattern</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Standardize output and interfaces across the containers to provide a simple, homogenized view to external applications.</li>
  <li>A common example is using a single tool for collecting/processing metrics from multiple applications.</li>
  <li>This is different from the adapter pattern, which aims to provide a simplified view of the external world to an application.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="multi-node-application-patterns">Multi-node application patterns</h2>

<h3 id="leader-election-pattern">Leader election pattern</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In a sharded (or replication-based) system, the system may have to elect a leader (or multiple leaders) among the replicas (or shards).</li>
  <li>Instead of using a leader election library, a leader election container can be used (that communicates with other containers over, say, HTTP). This removes the restriction of using a leader election library compatible with the containers (e.g., using the same language).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="work-queue-pattern">Work queue pattern</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A work coordinator container can queue different containers, each of which may have a different implementation or dependencies, thus removing the restriction that all the works use the same runtime.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scattergather-pattern">Scatter/gather pattern</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An external client sends a request to a root container.</li>
  <li>This container fans out the request to many containers that may perform the computation in parallel.</li>
  <li>The root container gathers these parallel computationsâ€™ results and aggregates them into a response to the external client.</li>
</ul>
