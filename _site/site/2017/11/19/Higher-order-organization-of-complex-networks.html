<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Given a <a href="https://shagunsodhani.in/papers-I-read/Network-Motifs-Simple-Building-Blocks-of-Complex-Networks">motif M</a>, the framework aims to find a cluster of the set of nodes S such that nodes of S participate in many instances of M and avoid cutting instances of M (that is only a subset of nodes in instances of M appears in S).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mathematically, the aim is to minimise the motif conductance metric given as <em>cut<sub>M</sub>(S, S’) / min[vol<sub>M</sub>(S), vol<sub>M</sub>(S’)]</em> where <em>S’</em> is complement of <em>S</em>, <em>cut<sub>M</sub>(S, S’)</em> = number of instances of M which have atleast one node from both <em>S</em> and <em>S’</em> and <em>vol<sub>M</sub>(S)</em> = Number of nodes in instances of M that belong only to S.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solving the above equation is computationally infeasible and an approximate solution is proposed using eigenvalues and matrices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approximate solution is easy to implement, efficient and guaranteed to find clusters that are at most a quadratic factor away from the optimal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Given the network and motif M, form a motif adjacency matrix W<sub>M</sub> where W<sub>M</sub>(i, j) is the number of instances of M that contains i and j.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute spectral ordering of the nodes from normalized motif laplacian matrix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute prefix set of spectral ordering with small motif conductance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scalability">Scalability</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Worst case <em>O(m<sup>1.5</sup>)</em>, based on experiments <em>O(m<sup>1.2</sup>)</em> where <em>m</em> is the number of edges.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Applicable to directed, undirected and weighted graphs (allows for negative edge weights as well).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case the motif is not known beforehand, the framework can be used to compute significant motifs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed framework unifies the two fundamental tools of network science (motif analysis and network partitioning) along with some worst-case guarantees for the approximations employed and can be extended to identify higher order modular organization of networks.</p>
  </li>
