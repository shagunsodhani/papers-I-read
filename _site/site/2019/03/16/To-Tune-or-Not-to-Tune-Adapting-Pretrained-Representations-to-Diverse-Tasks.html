    <p>Main observations</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Feature extraction and fine-tuning have comparable performance in most cases unless the two tasks are highly similar(fine-tuning is better) or highly dissimilar (feature extraction is better).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For ELMo, feature extraction consistently outperforms fine-tuning for the sentence pair tasks (NLI, PD, STS). The reverse trend is observed for BERT with fine-tuning being better on sentence pair tasks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Adding extra parameters is helpful for feature extraction but not fine-tuning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ELMo fine-tuning requires careful tuning and other tricks like triangular learning rates, gradual unfreezing and discriminative fine-tuning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For the tasks considered, there is no correlation observed between the distance of the source and target domains and adaptation performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Training a diagnostic classifier (on the intermediate representations) suggests that fine-tuning improves the performance of the classifier at all the intermediate layers (which is sort of expected).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In terms of mutual information estimates, fine-tuned representations have a much higher mutual information as compared to the feature extraction based representations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Knowledge for single sentence tasks seems to be mostly concentrated in the last layers while for pair classification tasks, the knowledge seems gradually build un in the intermediate layers, all the way up to the last layer.</p>
