<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The paper introduces Contrastively-trained Structured World Models (C-SWMs).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These models use a contrastive approach for learning representations in environments with compositional structure.</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The training data is in the form of an experience buffer \(B = \{(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\}_{t=1}^T\) of state transition tuples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The goal is to learn:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>an encoder \(E\) that maps the observed states $s_t$ (pixel state observations) to latent state $z_t$.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a transition model \(T\) that predicts the dynamics in the hidden state.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The model defines the enegry of a tuple \((s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\) as \(H = d(z_t + T(z_t, a_t), z_{t+1})\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The model has an inductive bias for modeling the effect of action as translation in the abstract state space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extra hinge-loss term is added: \(max(0, \gamma - d(z^{~}_{t}, z_{t+1}))\) where \(z^{~}_{t} = E(s^{~}_{t})\) is a corrputed latent state corresponding to a randomly sampled state \(s^{~}_{t}\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="object-oriented-state-factorization">Object-Oriented State Factorization</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The goal is to learn object-oriented representations where each state embedding is structured as a set of objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assuming the number of object slots to be \(K\), the latent space, and the action space can be factored into \(K\) independent latent spaces (\(Z_1 \times ... \times Z_K\)) and action spaces (\(A_1 \times ... \times A_k\)) respectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <em>K</em> CNN-based object extractors and an MLP-based object encoder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions are represented as one-hot vectors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fully connected graph is induced over <em>K</em> objects (representations) and the transition function is modeled as a Graph Neural Network (GNN) over this graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transition function produces the change in the latent state representation of each object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The factorization can be taken into account in the loss function by summing over the loss corresponding to each object.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="environments">Environments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grid World Environments - 2D shapes, 3D blocks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Atari games - Pong and Space Invaders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3-body physics simulation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Random policy is used to collect the training data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evaluation is performed in the latent space (no reconstruction in the pixel space) using ranking metrics. The observations (to compare against) are randomly sampled from the buffer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Baselines - auto-encoder based World Models and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11169">Physics as Inverse Graphics model</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the grid-world environments, C-SWM models the latent dynamics almost perfectly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removing either the state factorization or the GNN transition model hurts the performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C-SWM performs well on Atari as well but the results tend to have high variance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The optimal values of $K$ should be obtained by hyperparameter tuning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the 3-body physics tasks, both the baselines and proposed models work quite well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly, the paper has a section on limitations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The object extractor module can not disambiguate between multiple instances of the same object (in a scene).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The current formulation of C-SWM can only be used with deterministic environments.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
